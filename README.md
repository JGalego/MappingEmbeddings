# A Tour of GenAI

## Overview

Everything you need to know about Generative AI (or GenAI for short)... no hype, no hubris, no hogwash!

## Organization

You can "read" it as the story of what came ‘before’, as in before GenAI became this big, explosive ‘thing’ it is today, what we have now (warts and all) and how we can use it to build incredible stuff, and what is coming (tbh this part still needs some work).

The presentation requires some background knowledge and it doesn’t shy away from the technical details, but I tried my best to keep the math and jargon to a minimum. This may seem paradoxical, but it’s not.

Feel free to explore and just DM me if you find any bugs!
